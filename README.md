## Instructions

### How to run

To run the game, download or clone the repo and open index.html in a browser.

### How to Play

The goal of the game is to match all the pairs of cards on the board. Try to win in as few moves and shortest time as possible.

Click on a card to turn it over. If the cards match, they will be locked in position. If not, they will be turned back over. Only two cards can be turned over at a time.

The game is won when all the cards are matched.
